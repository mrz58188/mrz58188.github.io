<p style="color:white">The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution is a direct competitor to the Subaru WRX STI. Both heavily competed to create the best rally cars during the 1990's.</p>
<p style="color:white">The result of their competition created some of the best street legal rally cars for car enthusiasts to enjoy.</p>

<p><img src="3000gt.jpg" alt="3000gt" width="250" height="150" style="float:center"></p>
<p style="color:white">This car was made in conjunction with Chrysler in a merger known as Diamond Star Motors.</p>
<p style="color:white">There are two versions of this car, the one that Mitsubshi created was called the 3000GT.</p>
<p style="color:white">The car Chrysler created was called the Dodge Stealth, pictured below.</p>

<p style="color:white">The Dodge Stealth was discontinued after only a few years.</p>

<p><img src="MitsubishiEclipse.jpg" alt="mitsubishieclipse" width="250" height="175" style="float:center"></p>
<p style="color:white">The Mitsubishi Eclipse was another car that gained its fame through the "Fast and the Furious" movie franchise.</p>
<p style="color:white">In my opinion, the 2nd generation, or "2G Eclipse," was the best looking eclipse eclipse out of the 4 different face lifts that the car underwent throughout its existence.</p>
