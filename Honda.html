<h2 style="color:white">This is the Honda NSX</h2>
<p style="color:white">The Honda NSX is a JDM legend because it was the first Japanese "supercar."</p>
<p style="color:white">Its styling was bold and resembled a fighter jet. Many consumers were surprised that Honda decided to make this car in the first place</p>
<p style="color:white">If the name "Honda NSX" does not sound familiar to you, that is because it is called the "Acura NSX" in the United States</p>
<p style="color:white">Acura is the luxury brand for Honda that is only used in North America.</p>



<p><img src="HondaS2000.jpg" alt="hondas2000" width="250" height="150" style="float:center"></p>
<p style="color:white">The Honda S2000, commonly refered to as the "S2k," is the only other rear wheel drive car to come from Honda besides the NSX.</p>
<p style="color:white">It was made to compete with the likes of the Mazda Miata and the Toyota MR2.</p>
